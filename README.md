## Budget Management system using ReactJS

Project Overview
The Budget Management System is a web application built using ReactJS to help users track their income, manage expenses, and visualize their financial habits. The app allows users to set a budget limit, record their income and expenses, and see a summary of their financial status at a glance. This application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

Key Features
Income and Expense Tracking: Users can easily add income and expense entries, specifying the amount, category, and date for each entry.

Budget Setting: The application allows users to set a monthly budget, enabling them to control their spending within a predefined limit.

Real-Time Summary: The dashboard provides an overview of total income, total expenses, and remaining budget, giving users an instant snapshot of their financial health.

Expense Categorization: Users can categorize their expenses (e.g., Food, Rent, Transportation), which helps in analyzing spending habits.

Data Persistence: User data is saved in the browser’s local storage, ensuring that information is retained even after the page is refreshed.

Responsive Design: The application is built to work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Technology Stack
ReactJS: Provides the component-based structure for building the user interface.
React Router: Manages in-app navigation, creating a single-page application feel.
CSS/SCSS: Custom styles ensure a clean and visually appealing user experience.
Local Storage: Used to store data persistently in the user's browser, allowing data to remain even after the page is closed or refreshed.
Installation & Setup
Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the project repository from GitHub.

Install Dependencies: Use npm to install the necessary packages and libraries required for the application.

Run the Application: Start the development server to preview the app locally in a browser.

How to Use
Dashboard View: The dashboard displays a quick summary of total income, total expenses, and the remaining budget. It updates in real time as new income or expense entries are added.

Adding Income and Expenses: Users can input details for income and expenses, specifying categories, amounts, and dates. This data will automatically reflect on the dashboard.

Setting a Monthly Budget: Users can set and adjust their budget, which will act as a spending limit for the month. As expenses are recorded, the remaining budget is calculated and displayed.

Expense Categories: Each expense can be categorized, enabling users to see where they’re spending the most.
